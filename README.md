# Llama's Bastion Practice

> A Bastion practice map for Minecraft 1.16.1 speedruns

## Introduction

Minecraft [bastions](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bastion_Remnant) are requisite for modern-day Minecraft [1.16.1](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.16.1) speedruns but are difficult to effectively practice due to their sheer number of potential variations and randomness the game enforces.

`Llama's Bastion Practice` is a map that attempts to give users full control over how they practice bastions. It contains a host of features and tools that let *you* decide how the bastions you practice will generate. With `LBP` you can effectively help to prepare yourself for real runs and gain the most from practice time.
