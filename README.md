# Llama's Bastion Practice

For those who want the [download](/)  
### *Heyo!*  

I have been working on this map for several months now after foolishly deciding that I wanted to create an accurate bastion practice map.  
The following features have been implemented in the map which make it near identical to how the game generates bastions.

## Features
- Random Terrain
- Random Block Processors
- Random Mobs
- Random Bastion Rotations  

I have also tried my best to allow the bastion to be customizable so you can decide exactly which bastion type you want to practice.  
This includes being able to customize the following:

## Customization
- Toggle Hoglins
- Toggle Terrain
- Toggle Random Gold Blocks
- Toggle Natural Mobs
- Toggle Loadout Armor
- Selectable Biome - *Note: Selecting a specific biome will greatly increase the time to start the run*
- Selectable Spawnpoint
- Selectable Reset Method

## Routing Mode
This is a mode I created to aid in bastion route creation and it includes a few tools to help manipulate the bastion.  
You can right click the sign below the start button to toggle the mode between `routing` and `running`
